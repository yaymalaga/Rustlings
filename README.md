## About

> Just after finishing The Book, I gave a try to the rustling exercises, in order to get an initial impression of the languague and my actual knowledge. 

Some years afterwards, I decided to re-do the rustling exercises. This time, I managed to make it to the Fe-nish line!! ;)

Don't forget to check it out [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) repo and try their exercises by yourself!
