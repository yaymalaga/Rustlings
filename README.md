## About

Just after finishing The Book, I gave a try to the rustling exercises, in order to get an initial impression of the languague and my actual knowledge. 

In this repo I have upload all my solutions. However, I still have some exercises to finish, such as *threads* or *standard_library_types* or *error_handling*.

If you want to check the exercises, you can execute them with:
```bash
rustlings verify
```
Take a look to the official README in order to get all the dependencies: [https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings). All credits for them!
